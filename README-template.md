### What I learned

This was my first project and it was quite challenging, but I learnt a lot.
* I'm not a PRO Member, so I've had to guess a lot of sizes with not so little trouble ðŸ˜…. I used Photoshop and the firefox developer tool to aid me in all the process, expecially for typography. 
* I found out that when resizing window with firefox developer tool, instead of int number for the content it uses float. This gave me a lot of trouble with the media queries, because at first I wanted to set the max width for the mobile at 375px and the min width for the desktop at 376px. The problem arose because when selecting a viewport of 375px the browser actually calculated the content at 375.2px (which makes no sense to me, I mean portions of 1 px don't exist), so in the range between 375 and 376 the media queries didn't work, because it was outside of range. After serching on google I found this link
* 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
